 I've heard that this world is terrifying and the speed of technology is... troubling. What if AI gets really advanced and kills or enslaves us? What if privacy doesn't exist anymore? What if I'm being advertised to and milked for all my money every waking moment of every day? What if I feel so powerless and alienated in this hyperactive, corporate, positivity-obsessed society that I've stopped caring?

 To me, technological developments aren't troubling. What is troubling is people. The people who see life as an opportunity to gather power and make money. The idea that those people will hire other people to create technologies that reflect the way they see the world. The idea that with mentality the environment will become unsustainable and all the people without money or social utility will be abandoned by the rest of humanity.

 At the moment theres the sense that the powerful value status and personal comfort above all else. People want money and a sense of safety in their tiny, resource-rich community. They are willing to prioritize this stability over being kind to the rest of humanity, especially the weak, and over keeping the planet healthy. They form organizations that exacerbate the worlds problems under the guise of trying to solve them.

 ####This sense does not bode well for a healthy perspective as a job-seeker.

 My engineering bootcamp classmates and I have flung our Santa-sacks of debt on our shoulders and begun walking across the digital wasteland to apply for jobs as software engineers. We cram algorithms. We try to show employers that we can design beautiful responsive web pages, successfully connect databases to external APIs, and to fit in with their culture of innovation and unlimited-snacking. But in many of us, there is a growing sense of unease.

 It's not a speedy process for most of us. It is exhausting and scary being unemployed and trying to project the sense of stability and confidence that employers seem to want when they are choosing who to hire. Then in addition there is that larger, more existential fear that perhaps you shouldn't have this job. Perhaps this company shouldn't even exist. Perhaps the best thing for humanity is to give up meat and find a nice forest cave to read in.

 I've learned that the best way to generate more energy and pull yourself out of these fearful states is to take a shower and see if you can change your perspective. Programmatic thinking can be useful. Look at job-search challenges (like failed code challenges, existential angst, and a desire not to write emails) in the way you might view errors in an application your are writing.

 You thought that keyword would work in the way you expected, but it didn't. Perhaps you forgot you were using Python instead of Ruby, or it's JS, but the browser you're using doesn't support ES6. Maybe you typed it wrong. Maybe you typed it in the wrong place. Maybe your computer is slow and the program just needs more time to compile. Maybe you have been coding for 12 hours and need to step away for a bit. Main takeaway, there are many, many opportunities for errors. Doesn't mean you suck at coding. Doesn't mean you suck at life.

 There are always reasons why something isn't working. With a job-search for a bootcamp graduate it could be that it's just objectively difficult given the volume of job-seeking people with your same skill-level relative to the amount of entry-level positions. The error could be your attitude, your ability to relate to people, or your nervousness during tech interviews.

 Whatever it is, you can figure it out. And make it better. I believe in you. And when you figure it out, you can let someone else going through the same thing in on the secret. And maybe it will be less painful for them.    

#### P.S. I considered transferring my older posts to a Medium blog. It could be less hassle and easier to communicate with strangers, but I like this way better. Feels safe writing in my text editor and there are no ads on the page.
