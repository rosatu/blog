There are brilliant programmers and brilliant communicators, but how many people can be both?

We are 6 weeks in and already I am already struggling to communicate what I’m doing to the people I love. I tried to explain the first app I built to my sister last week. After several minutes she finally had to interrupt me.

>Rosa, no words you have said so far mean anything to me. What are you talking about? What is “the command line?” ~my sister

I assume this will happen more as I learn more code. This is how it will go:


### I will think I am having a conversation with someone. They will be polite and smile at me. Finally I will realize that I have been babbling nonsense at them for the last twenty minutes and now they don’t feel like talking to me anymore. I will feel guilty and shuffle off, utterly alone.


It’s funny though, I feel like that’s someone’s dream. Is that someone’s dream? I think it is. I think some people like to go over other peoples’ heads. It makes them feel “smart.” It makes them feel special.

I am not one of those people. I like to be understood. I feel sad when I am unable to convey what I am trying to convey.

So, this is my experiment. I want to be able to communicate with non-tech people. But I don’t want to work so hard to do that. So, I need to build a mental function that will do it for me.

This function will iterate through my experiences and return my previous levels of understanding, ones that I existed in before I started learning to code. Once I’m in the level which matches the level of the party I am communicating with, I can begin conveying the correct data to them.  

```js
let theirUnderstandingLevel

fetch(`https://collective-consciousness/their-brain-codes`)
	.then(res => res.json())
	.then(data => theirUnderstandingLevel = data)

function matchUnderstandingLevel()=>{
	fetch(`https://collective-consciousness/my-brain-codes`)
	.then(res => res.json())
	.then(data => {
		 data.forEach(understanding) {
			if(understanding.level === theirUnderstandingLevel){
			console.log(`we’re good`)
			return letterToGrandma
			}else{
			console.log(`I’m a d-bag.`)
      return null
      }
    }  
  })
}
```

Great! Lets do it. Oh wait. That was all nonsense. Dangit.

Wait. Was it nonsense?

```ruby
const letterToGrandma = [

"Dear Grandma,
  I’m not sure how much you know about coding, but that’s what I’m studying right now, so I thought I’d tell you a bit about it.
  Essentially I’m learning how to write out directions for a computer to follow. I can write simple requests, similar to what you’d type into a calculator like “Dear computer, please add these numbers and show the result on your screen.”
  Or I can write more complicated requests like “Dear computer, please take this picture of my grandma and save it with the place and date. That way I can always look at it and know where and when it was taken”
  I write (well, type) these directions out using special keywords and symbols. For example, in the programming “language” Ruby, if I want the computer to display the word “Grandma” on the screen for me, I would type `puts “Grandma”`   
  Anyhow I hope you’re doing well. See you in December!

  Love,

  Rosa"

Yeah. I think it was.

Wait, was it?

Let's talk about it. Git push.
