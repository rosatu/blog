This is Rosa Tu's coding blog. Rosa Tu is a full-stack web developer and graduate of the Flatiron School who is looking for sweet jobs at sweet companies. She has built sites using Rails, React, and Django and writes in Ruby, JS, and a teeny tiny bit of Python. She also writes music. You can hear the music at [semperosa.com](https://semperosa.com/)

You can find the source code for Jekyll(the static blog generator I'm using for this) and Minima(this design theme) at GitHub:
